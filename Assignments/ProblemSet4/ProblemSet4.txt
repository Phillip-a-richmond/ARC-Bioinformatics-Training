# Problem Set 4

## Overview
This is the full pipeline problem set!

1) Copy this script to your workshop directory, and call it FullPipline_ProblemSet4.sh:

/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GenomeAnalysisModule/Scripts/FullPipeline_Sample1.sh

2) Edit the email address, workshop directory location, and sample IDs. Sample assignments are:

Ann - HG01583.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Emma - HG03006.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Jacob - HG03052.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Kiara - NA19648.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Loryn - NA20502.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Manraj - NA20845.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Jenna - HG01583.chr19.subregion_R*fastq
Tracey - NA19648.chr19.subregion_R*fastq

Note, the SAMPLE should be equal to HG01583.chr19.subregion, e.g.
SAMPLE=HG01583.chr19.subregion

3) Run the full pipeline through the scheduler 

4) Copy the VCF, sorted BAM, and BAM index to your local laptop. 

5) Visualize the variants alongside the reads in IGV.

6) Take an image of an indel and save it as ProblemSet4_indel.png.

7) Take an image of an SNV and save it as ProblemSet4_SNV.png

8) Email both images to prichmond@bcchr.ca

## Do the above by Wendesday November 11th ##

9) Phil will email you with the path to your fastq data for your case. 

10) Copy the FullPipeline_ProblemSet4.sh into 3 new scripts: 
FullPipeline_Proband.sh
FullPipeline_Father.sh
FullPipeline_Mother.sh

11) Change the sample IDs, and paths to fastq files in each of the 3 new scripts.

12) Run each script, change the permissions on your directory, and ping Phil on slack.
