Problemset Session 3


1) Make yourself a problemset 3 directory titled <LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME> in the directory:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session3/Problemset/

And copy this file into that directory (you will need to edit your copy to
fill in answers below) 
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session3/Problemset/Session3_Problemset.txt

2) Pick a sample from this directory (except NA20845), create a PBS script and map the reads to the genome.
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session3/Files/RAW_DATA/

Keep the output files in your problemset 3 directory.

3) Convert to sorted bam and get the stats using samtools flagstat.


4) How many reads were mapped in each of these samples?  
Find someone else in the class that has done the other samples to fill this out.
If that's not possible for you, then just fill out for your sample or run all
the samples yourself:

SampleID	NumMappedReads	NumProperlyPaired
HG01583
HG03006
HG03052
NA19648
NA20502

5) Secure copy the sorted bam file, and it's index to your own local computer, either using FileZilla,
another secure copy client, or the scp command.


6) Open up IGV, load the hg38 genome, and load the alignment.


7) Zoom in on the STK11 gene, and save the image (File --> Save image)


8) Upload the snapshot to your problemset 3 directory. 



9) There are more genomes than GRCh38 (hg38), and more organisms than just
human.
A) Pick an organism and genome build from:
http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html
B) Download the fasta file (.fa, .fasta., .fa.gz, .fa.tar.gz) from an online resource. 
C) Decompress it and concatenate chromosomes together (if necessary)
D) Create a PBS script to index the fasta file with bwa. 


10) What is your favourite book (any genre, except textbooks)?



11) Copy your problemset 3 directory (with this filled-out problemset in it) into:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session3/Problemset/Finished/

Change the permissions to be read, write, and execute for user, group, and world.


BONUS (Only perform these if you feel like the above don't challenge your abilities):
12) Remap the reads for one of the samples and change the -T and -k options for BWA. Change -T to 60, and change -k to 10.
What are the results with default reads mapped vs. these new settings?

Default:


New Settings:


13) Remap the reads using the variable-based PBS script.
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session3/Files/SCRIPTS/MapAndConvertVariables.pbs
This is a template, make sure you edit it to match your own needs.
