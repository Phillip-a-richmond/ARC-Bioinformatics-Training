This problemset will incorporate some elements of session 3.
If you need to, you can repurpose your old scripts from session 3 in order to
do this problem set.  I highly recommend this.

1) Create a Problemset 4 directory in:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session4/Problemset/


2) Copy this file into that directory:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session4/Problemset/Session4_Problemset.txt


3) Copy these fastq files into your workshop 4 directory:
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session4/Files/RAW_DATA/NA12889_chrom20_R1.fastq
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session4/Files/RAW_DATA/NA12889_chrom20_R2.fastq


4) Generate a PBS script that will take these reads and do the following:
(Hint: You can copy-paste from scripts we've already used in class)

A) Map against this genome index (a version of hg19):
/global/scratch/ARC_Training/Session4/Files/GENOME/hs37d5.fa

B) Convert into bam, sort, and index the mapped file

C) Call variants on the bam file using Freebayes

D) Bgzip and tabix the vcf file


5) Download the resulting .sorted.bam, .sorted.bam.bai, and .vcf files onto
your local computer.


6) Load the reads and the vcf file into IGV.
Zoom in so your window is 300bp in size.




7) Take an IGV snapshot of a deletion with a quality score  > 100, and title it: 
NA12889_deletion.png

(make sure to keep the correct window size)


8) Take a snapshot of an SNV with a quality score > 100 (single nucleotide change) and title it:
NA12889_snv.png


(make sure to keep the correct window size)



9) How many properly paired reads mapped?



10) How many variants in your vcf file are not from chromosome 20?




11) Which lesson(s) are you attending next week?

Monday - Variant annotation and exploration using GEMINI



Tuesday - RNA seq mapping of whole-brain RNAseq in mouse, and transcript
quantifiation in preparation for differential expression analysis.



Wednesday - Differential expression analysis starting with a geneXsample
matrix (guest lecture from Jasleen Grewal)
This analysis will be walked through via R-markdown, and more information
about the Jasleen Grewal Experience coming soon.




12) What is your favourite animal?




13) Surprise, this is the exam.  Everything above covers what we've learned in
session 1-4.  If you can do this, you can do anything.

When you're finished, please email Phillip.a.richmond@gmail.com with this
completed problemset, and the two images from IGV (NA12889_deletion.png,
NA12889_SNV.png)
