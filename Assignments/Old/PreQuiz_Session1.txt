Pre-Quiz for Session 1.  To be completed before June 5th.

Welcome to the Introduction to Genomic Analysis Workshop Series!

Each session will have a pre-session quiz, but since the course hasn't started this quiz will be quite short.

Other sessions will have more difficult quizzes, that will require some additional time and effort outside of class.  

I urge you to work together on these quizzes and problem sets.

1.) Visit the Course website (https://phillip-a-richmond.github.io/GenomeAnalysisModule/).

2.) Complete the prerequisites on the course website if you haven't already.  These include:

  A.) Install Vidyo
  B.) For PC Users, install MobaXTerm (or Putty)
  C.) Install a File transfer client (Example: FileZilla)

3.) Open up your terminal (on Mac just find the terminal application, on PC open up MobaXTerm). 
Log-in to the WestGrid Compute Cluster known as Orcinus (see example commands below).  
The address of the cluster is: orcinus@westgrid.ca. 
If you are a temporary user, you will not be able to test logging in until after May 29th.

  ssh <username>@host
  example: ssh richmonp@orcinus.westgrid.ca
  example: ssh wg-user07@orcinus.westgrid.ca

If you have trouble with this, please contact wgcomms@computecanada.ca IMMEDIATELY! 
The entire course is hosted on this server, so if you can't log in before class...
You are going to have a bad time, mmkay.

4.) Take a quick peek at the Session 1 slides (link on the website).  
If you are feeling incredibly overwhelmed due to being very new to the linux command line, 
then consider taking this linux tutorial (http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/).

5.) Email me (phillip.a.richmond@gmail.com) with the following:

  A.) Were you able to log in?  (if No, have you contacted wgcomms@computecanada.ca?)
  B.) What is your experience level with linux shell?
  C.) What do you hope to get out of the course?
  D.) What is your current favourite song (Artist, Song Name)?  Just trying to find some new tunes (>'.')>   <('.'<)
