This problem set will review the basic commands from the lecture, and add some new commands I didn't teach you (GASP!!!)

The examples in this problem set will also guide you through exploring different file formats commonly used in genomics.  
For help with file formats, use...the Internet!  Example: http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html 


1) Create a "Problemset directory" with your last name and first initial in all caps within:

/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GA_Module/Session1/Problemset/

2) Copy this Session1 Problem set into your Problemset directory:
/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GA_Module/Session1/Problemset/Session1_Problemset.txt

3) Copy this file into your Problemset directory:
/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/Session1/Files/genes.gtf

3) Rename the file to be called: hg38_genes.gtf

4) Extract all lines that correspond to the gene "GRN", and save them in a file called GRN.gtf 

5) Double check your GRN.gtf to make sure it only has lines corresponding to GRN in it.  
If it doesn't, redo your command in #4 using the whole-word option from the grep command.

6) Extract all lines that correspond to the gene "TTN", and save them in a file called TTN.gtf 

7) Delete the smaller of the two gtf files: GRN.gtf and TTN.gtf

8) Make a BED file (chromosome,start,stop tab separated) of the CDS entries for TTN called TTN.bed
(hint cut -f)

9) Download the clinvar vcf file into your Problemset Directory:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/vcf_GRCh38/clinvar.vcf.gz

10) Unzip the clinvar.vcf.gz file

11) Extract all variant lines corresponding to the gene ABCD1 from the clinvar file into a file called:
ABCD1_clinvar.vcf

12) Check the number of lines in the ABCD1_clinvar.vcf file.

13) Extract all variant lines corresponding to the gene SLC6A8 from the clinvar.vcf file into a file called:
SLC6A8_clinvar.vcf

14) Concatenate the ABCD1_clinvar.vcf and SLC6A8_clinvar.vcf files into a single file called combined_clinvar.vcf

15) Extract the header lines (starting with "#") from the file clinvar.vcf and add them to the top of combined_clinvar.vcf to make a new file called:
ABCD1_SLC6A8_clinvar.vcf

16) Compress the file ABCD1_SLC6A8_clinvar.vcf using gzip

17) Copy your Problemset directory into /mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/Session1/Problemset/Finished/

18) Change the permissions on your directory to be read, write, and execute for user, group, and world.
