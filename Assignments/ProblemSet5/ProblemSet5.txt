# Problem Set 5

## Overview
Here, you will take a single case (Case 10), and run Exomiser on the VCF and PED file, and then interpret the results.

1. Make a ProblemSet5 directory inside your workshop directory.

2. Copy this problem set file into your ProblemSet5 directory.

3. Copy the Exomiser scripts from case 4 into the ProblemSet5 directory:
/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GenomeAnalysisModule/Scripts/RunExomiser_case4.sh
/mnt/scratch/Public/TRAINING/GenomeAnalysisModule/Scripts/Case4_Exomiser.yml

4. Edit the scripts to process the Case10 data.

5. Run the Exomiser analysis for Case 10.

6. Download the HTML to your computer, and examine the results. Which is the gene you believe to be responsible for the phenotype (answer below)?
# ANKRD11



7. What is the clinvar ID for the pathogenic variant(s) responsible for the phenotype (answer below)?
# 658274




8. Are there any other candidate genes you should consider (answer below)?
# WDR11, MVK



9. Notify Phil that you are finished and take a break.
