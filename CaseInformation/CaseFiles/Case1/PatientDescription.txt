A two year old boy presents to his pediatrician with bloody diarrhea, eczema, petechiae and easy bruising with no associated trauma. He has had multiple treatments for otitis media (ear infections). Investigations reveal thrombocytopenia (decreased number of platelets) and abnormal morphology (small platelets). The proband is an only child. Both parents do not have any significant medical problems. The family history is significant for a maternal uncle with autoimmune problems and a recent diagnosis of lymphoma.
