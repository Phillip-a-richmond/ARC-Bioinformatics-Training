A six year old boy is seen by his pediatrician as his mother noted that he has become hyperactive, easily distracted and impulsive. His mother said he was behind with respect to language skills, fine motor skills and coordination. She also expressed concern to the physician that he continues to resist eating solid foods as he frequently chokes and gags when eating. He was a normal appearing male with a slight build. He had increased muscle tone with brisk reflexes at the patellae bilaterally. He was referred to neurology and brain imaging identified symmetric enhancement of signal in the parieto-occipital region with evidence of neuronal loss. The family history was otherwise negative for significant medical concerns. Parents are nonconsanguineous.
