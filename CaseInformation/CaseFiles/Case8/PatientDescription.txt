A 12-month-old male was seen for routine well child care. His gestation was notable for possible fetal hydrops, but this resolved spontaneously in the beginning of the 3rd trimester. Amniocentesis revealed a normal male karyotype. During the neonatal period, he was identified as having a heart murmur and unilateral cryptorchidism. An echocardiogram was performed and showed a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and mild pulmonary valve dysplasia. His developmental milestones were within the normal range, but were at the lower limits of normal for gross motor and language skills. On physical exam he was noted to have short stature with characteristic facial features including low-set, posteriorly rotated ears, widely-spaced eyes, a short and broad nose and wide neck.
