A 41 year old male presents to his family doctor with fatigue and abdominal pain. Initial investigations included a complete blood count, renal and liver panels. He had normocytic anemia and mild elevations of hepatic enzymes. Imaging (CT) of the abdomen demonstrated several hypoattenuating lesions in the liver and edema of the bowel mucosa at the ileocecal junction. Colonoscopy revealed a large mass protruding into the lumen of the distal part of the ascending colon. Subsequent histopathology revealed an adenocarcinoma with negative margins. Microsatellite instability was high. There was no significant family history of cancer or other illnesses.
