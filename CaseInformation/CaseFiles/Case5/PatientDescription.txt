A two year-old female presented for a well child check. Her early pediatric milestones were reassuring, she walked shortly after her first birthday and began talking around the same time. However, at the appointment, her mother notes that she is no longer using words that she used to and that she no longer feeds herself and seems less engaged. On examination, her growth parameters are in the normal range, but are notable for minimal growth in head circumference over the last 9 months. She verbalizes but does not make intelligible words and does not reciprocate in verbal exchange. She is an only child and the family history is negative with respect to significant medical problems.
