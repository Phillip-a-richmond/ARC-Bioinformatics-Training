A two year old male presented to his pediatrician with a fever of unknown origin. He was underweight for height and had a history of loose stools. His work up demonstrated an elevated white count. His chest x-ray showed patchy atelectasis (partial collapse of the lung) and a R middle lobe infiltrate. He was admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from culture from a  sputum sample. He underwent sweat chloride testing which was positive. The family history revealed a healthy older sister. Parents were in good health and nonconsanguineous. His mother was of Scottish heritage, and his father was Irish.
