An 8 year old boy was referred to genetics and had the following clinical presentation: mild intellectual disability, short stature, microcephaly, triangular face, large and prominent ears, hypertelorism, long palpebral fissures and macrodontia. Both parents attended the appointment and the geneticist noted that the mother demonstrated similar craniofacial findings to the son. Upon further questioning, it was revealed that the mother is similarly affected, displaying moderate intellectual disability, and overlap of symtpoms with the child.
